Traditional [[Kheiossand|Kheiossan]] cuisine is heavily based on various sea food (predominantly Oysters) combined with mushrooms and eggs.

Nowadays mushrooms and eggs are still an integral part of the cuisine, especially fungi, which are seen as a food for the poor.
Seafood and Oysters however are not very common anymore, as overfishing and pollution has driven both into extinction around the city. The rich still like to eat Oysters and sea fish, importing it from further away for a lot of money.
