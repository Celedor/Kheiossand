In the city of [[Kheiossand]], [[The Puppeteer]]; one of the three [[Kheioi]] and one of the six councilors, oversees everything criminal or shady. This network underneath them is called the Web of Lies/Knives or just the Web.

Crime is still very much illegal in the city, but the city watch usually isn't doing much against it, mostly because of corruption, but also because their main task has switched to defending the city itself from fire and other destruction. The Puppeteer has a lot of businesses under them that run relatively freely without much interference from the city. Every single individual under the Puppeteer does have a contract though that may not have been issued by them, but definitely does go back to them. These contracts work twofold; on one hand, they give the people protection from the web and others outside of it. On the other hand, they very clearly outline how much liberty that person has; if they can only pickpocket, embezzle or potentially assassinate. If someone rises in the rinks, a new contract has to be made.

If someone acts without a contract or oversteps it, they will not be dealt with by the city watch, but the Web will strike swiftly and without mercy. Every instance of these serves as a gruesome reminder how deep with the city is caught in the web.
