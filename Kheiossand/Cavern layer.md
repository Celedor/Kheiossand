A connection to the [[Caverns]] that span throughout all of Kheiossar.

Right underneath the cities the caverns have two official "layers". First, there are the basements of buildings, hideouts, shady business and other buildings, cathedrals and other things that would benefit from being hidden from sight.
Underneath that and sometimes nestled within the first layer, is the fungal layer. Here Circles of Spore Druids reside and live within the vibrant ecosystem of these caves. Abstract and weird creatures live here in addition to the fungi, as well as newly some strange unknown races and species not found anywhere else.

A large part of the [[Kheiossand|cities]]' dead are also brought here and disposed of, mostly through the fungi. Some people living in the city do not want this impersonal disposal and instead opt for the way more expensive and complicated option of a funeral, however these may look depending on their culture.
