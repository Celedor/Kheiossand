Anders Deuntje is a [[Changelings|Changeling]] that oversees a large part of the show-business and pleasure-business in [[Kheiossand]]. She is a Changeling that employs a lot of other Changelings, but also others.
She is known to take in lost children, exiles and other outcasts. To most of them she shows a kind and caring side, helping them get back on their feet and sometimes taking them in into their little family of artists. 
She is kindly known as "Tantje" or "Auntie".

None alive can remember her as a young person anymore, for she lives here and offers a home for all the lost children and artists since anyone can remember.

While most people under her care artists of all different kinds, many of them also serve as informants for her, and so she has ears and eyes nearly everywhere in the district.
