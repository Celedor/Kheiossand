Although no one knows their exact age, it is said to be at least 300 years, with the true number possibly getting close to 400 or even higher. With this, Greed is the oldest known [[Kianeroi|Kianeros]] in [[Kheiossand]].

When they came into being, the [[Web of Lies(Knives)]] was already strong and very established and so they didn't have any other choice than joining it and moving their way slowly up. By backstabbing and establishing their own niche, they were able to not only prolong their life and gaining more and more power.
Nowadays they rule their own little enterprise and are one of the most powerful and influential people in the Web, besides [[The Puppeteer]] of course. They tend to employ a lot of Kianeroi and, if they are useful, keep them around and supplied with [[Kianemos]]. However, just as much as they are supplying them, they can and will also cut their supply if their use has found an end. They are also known to cannibalize Kianeroi that have lost their usefulness in order to get some last use out of them.

While they are Kianeros, they aren't really interested in giving their own people rights. For if they would have rights, it would make it harder for them to get new recruits.
Of course not all people serving under Greed are Kianeroi, but nearly all long-lived Kianeroi are found here.

Given the affinity of the Kianeroi, Greed deals a lot with magical things of all kinds. Be it pure magic, artifacts or artificery. However, he is very careful to not use magic himself, as he's very cautious of loosing his lifeforce.
