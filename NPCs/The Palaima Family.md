Palaima - old blood

No one living in [[Kheiossand]] doesn't know the name "Palaima". Their members are everywhere in higher positions, be it in the military, finances, trading, art or whatever else. Not all of them are sorcerers, but they are known to have many sorcerers among their midst, beings that can tap into the [[Kianemos]] with their own inept powers.

Inheritance of the head of the family always goes to a selected heir, not necessarily their child, whom the hierarch raises and teaches on their own. Once the heir is ready, the hierarch often abdicates and isn't really seen anymore. probably living out their life on one of the many mansions the family owns outside the city.

They say that they can trace their family heritage back to the [[Kheioi]] themselves, possibly through [[Demigods]]. The Kheioi however do neither deny nor confirm that. None the less, the family does possess power beyond normal human possibilities.

Current head of the family is Lysander Palaima.

In truth the House head is a Hierarch. He's a lich who is binding the entire family to himself through the blood, with a select few members of the family acting as his phylacteries, gaining more powers, but also more reliance on the Hierarch.
When the Hierarch becomes old and the selected heir is ready, the blood in the heir takes over and puts the consciousness of the Hierarch into the young body, basically replacing the heir and living on as the Hierarch.
