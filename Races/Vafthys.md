Relatively recently, a group of small and sturdy people have been found at the surface levels of [[caverns]] all around the world, but mostly in [[Kheiossand]] itself. Their skin seemed to be entirely made out of stone, versed with numerous mysterious runes, but they were still able to move with an agility and speed unnatural for a being made out of stone.
They couldn't speak any known languages but seemed to be fleeing from something underground. After they were nicknamed "Vafthys" or "Deep Ones", they were given shelter and people found out that they were very adept at fighting (although in weird fighting styles), smithing and especially artificery. However, their artificery was very different from the way others have done it so far. Instead of using pure [[Kianemos]], they embedded the surface of the object with distinct and filigrane runes, which seemed to funnel the [[Kianemos]] naturally.

After the first group appeared, more and more Vafthys appeared on the surface of Kheiossar, even if most still appeared in [[Kheiossand]].
It is unclear if they are all from the same place or if that place even still exists. One thing is clear, their arrival sparks a new age.
