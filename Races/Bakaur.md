Bakaur - literally meaning Roots or Branches of the Mangrove Tree

The Bakaur live in the [[Land of the Bakaur]], which is a huge Mangrove Forest, stretching over many miles and the scattered islands. In its center is [[The Eternal Protector]] and watches over her children.
The Bakaur themselves are large upright walking lizards who live in small communes and tribes, without a strict hierarchy.
Central to any Bakaur village, is the hatchery, where eggs are brought to and raised by the whole village as one. As such, Bakaur do not have parent-child relations as many other species know them.

The individual tribes are in no way united, but the overseeing elders can convene a grand meeting of the tribes to discuss important matters at hand.
