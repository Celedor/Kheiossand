On rare occasions, when pure Kianemos becomes especially volatile, a Kianeros can be born. Before the modernization and building of magical infrastructure this was a rare occurrence, now they are rather common, especially in big cities.

Due to their entire being consisting of pure Kianemos, their bodies are extremely unstable and most Kianeroi do not live past a year. As such, most of them tend to live a very hedonistic life, enjoying their time to the absolute fullest. Unfortunately, this also brings a lot of them into crime. Not only is that a way how one can get a lot of money in a short time, especially when one does not have to deal with long term repercussion, but most states do not accept Kianeroi as actual people yet, so most don't have any other choice, even if they wanted to.

With how their bodies have been created and Kianemos being their literal life force, Kianeroi are very adept at magic. However, they cannot rest and regain their spent energy, so any energy they spend on magic takes away from their life force.
However, there is a way for the Kianeroi to elongate their life; by consuming pure Kianemos in any of its forms.
Unfortunately for them, this is usually very expensive and is only really possible if they have a rich benefactor or are being hired by someone wealthy. However, if they do get a sufficent supply, they can outlive any of the other species, so far it is unknown if they have a limit to how old they can get.

When they form, they often adapt simple words which they hear rather quickly as their name. What word they pick depends on their preference and nature.

Others can also consume Kianemos, but for non-Kianeroi it acts as a very potent drug that enhances magical abilities.
