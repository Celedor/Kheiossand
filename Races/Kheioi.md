Kheioi are humanoid creatures that generally stand at around 4-5 meters tall with widely varying heads on top of their shoulders, usually corresponding somewhat with their field of expertise. For example, the [[The Great River Mother]]'s head is a water sphere floating above the shoulders with no connection, with two snakes circling around it and down the arms.
They do not age naturally and were long said to be immortal. Recent events have shown them to be "merely" nigh immortal instead. Their connection to [[Kianemos]] is incredibly powerful and makes them the strongest known creatures. Most of the stationary Kheioi have created sanctums, where their power reaches their former peak, they can recharge and where their followers can connect better to Kianemos as well. While wizards and sorcerers gain access to the Winds mostly through their own studies, Clerics, Warlocks and Paladins get it through a Kheios' connection, or in their permanent absence, through their sanctum.

The Kheioi that live in this world are all revered as Gods and many of them have created their own people and realms, over which many of them rule. There are some, that haven't done either and travel around the world, lending their services to anyone in need, be that war or charity.

Some of the most powerful and oldest beings in the world. While there are only 19(18) left nowadays, in the past it is said that they were much more numerous until a bloody war cut their numbers down and scarred the remaining ones physically and emotionally.
While they have names they are known by among their children, it is rumored that they also have their own, personal names, which only they themselves know and are spoken only amongst themselves.
