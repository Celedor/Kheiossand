Just like when [[The Justicar]] was still alive, the church is lead by the Great Judge. With the death of their patron however, the clerics and paladins lost much of their power, but with the sanctum still in their control, they still have access to some of it. Now it has become a much rarer commodity however, with only the most trusted members getting access to it. The rest are still formidable, but mundane fighters.

They seek to bring control and order back to [[Prennso]], more united than it was before, and to eradicate the practice of arcane magic, which they see as unnatural. While this practice was already present while the Judge was still alive, his death renewed their vigor and made them pursue their goal with much enthusiasm. They see it as his last will and as justice for his killing.

Sorcerers are abominations,
Wizards are heretics, 
They deserve only death.
