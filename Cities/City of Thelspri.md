The duchy of Thelspri and [Loshk]() is a dual-duchy that is ruled by a duke of the house Kairas.
In the distant past, the two cities were their own duchies, but Aniketos Minakis inherited both duchies from his parents each. his father owned Loshk and his mother Thelspri. As he was raised with his mother in Thelspri, he held his seat of power in Thelspri when he ascended to the throne. With his ascension to the throne, he also started and funded both universities, putting the more important and influential one of the arcana in his home town.
