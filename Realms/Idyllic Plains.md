The Idyllic Plains are nestled between coasts, mountains and hills to the north of [[Kheiossand]] and as such is in a very protected position.
Its lands are very fertile and the [[Tabaxi]] population lives pastoral and idyllic lives with only few cities in the plains. The population is very large and the riches attract pirates and other raiders, that are trying to plunder or enslave the Tabaxi.
While they succeed in this sometimes, every Tabaxi is trained in basic combat and as such they are able to raise a large militia, with a professional but small core, which is usually mounted.
It's not uncommon that Tabaxi that are talented in combat go out and try their luck as mercenaries overseas.

[[The Idyllic Custodian]] is the Kheios overseeing the Plains who has created the Tabaxi. She doesn't rule as much as she oversees and tends to the fields and her children.
