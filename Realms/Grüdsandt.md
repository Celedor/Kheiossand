Lies to the north of [[Prennso]], is the northernmost part of the western continent.
Is mostly inhabited by [[Orcs]], but a lot of migration is coming towards it, as it is the biggest realm not influenced by any [[Kheioi]] and the closest to a democracy, so nearly all races can be found here.

This realm is inspired by France and England

Recently became independent from its southern neighbor Prennso. Has a distinct culture and as [[The Justicar]] became distant and decadent, they didn't feel like they were represented by the capital anymore. With the border between the two mostly being one mountain-pass and Prennso having a lot of infighting, it wasn't very hard for them to keep their independence. But there were still a lot of border skirmishes in the mountains or forests that make their border.
Now with the Prenntic Civil War Gr√ºdsandt is expanding its influence to the south, in order to create a buffer state between them and Prennso.

Its council is formed by 20 people, 15 of which are Orcs and the last 5 seats are between the minorities, with usually at least 2 of those going to the [[Halflings]].

The mountain pass in the south is heavily fortified and a large defensive structure has been erected to keep the Justicar's forces out.
The southern mountains and hills also are very rich in resources, especially iron, which give them their color and their name. The north has many great forests, which deliver great quality wood.
