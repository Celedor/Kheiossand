Vejtals lies at the archipelago north of the desert and in the southern strait, as well as owning a few islands across Kheiossar.
It's mostly inhabited by [[Halflings]], but it also has many merchants from the other nations living in it.

Vejtals is influenced by the Dutch and northern Italian city states.

Originally starting up in the forests and plains in the north of the desert, they have soon spread out throughout the continent and a large part of the trade in Kheiossar goes through them. As such, they defacto control trade and the economy. They also have guilds and trade posts set up in most of the big cities, fueling the spread of technology, especially when it comes to monetary stuff like book-keeping, money-exchange, an early form of paper money and an early version of banks.

They also have by far the biggest fleet at the moment, basically controlling the waves together with [[Aupuni Nalu]].

It is governed by a council of the 5 wealthiest families, each sending 3 ambassadors to the councils out of their own ranks (usually the house head and the two eldest children, if applicable).
Out of these 5 wealthy families, one house head gets elected as the head of state until their death, at which point a new one is elected. 

[[The Golden Tycoon]] oversees the monetary policy and the Taxation in the home states, but does not govern the state. In many areas, they are more a celebrity than an actual power holder at this point.

They have a Trade Company, the [[Vejtals North Sea Company]] which controls a lot of trade going on overseas.
