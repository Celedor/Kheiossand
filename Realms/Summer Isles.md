To the west of [[Prennso]] lie the Summer Isles. It is mostly inhabited by [[Lizardfolk]], but some [[Orcs]] have also moved in from the east. 

Inspired by Polynesian cultures

Shielded by swamps in the north and hills in the south beyond the water, its only direct access is to the east. They have a rich and vibrant culture and live in relative peace, thanks to [[The Joyous Romantic]] that watches over them. They conduct business and trade with Prennso to the east but do not meddle with their politics.

Every island has their own king with one of them being elected as the high king to rule over all of them, but this is mostly an honorary title and they do not have alot of jurisdiction on the other islands.
The local [[Kheioi|Kheios]], the Joyous Romantic, doesn't rule or govern, instead they tend to the islands and surrounding seas like a garden and are often seen taking care of nature or enjoying their life on the island as many other inhabitants would.

The lizardman are also very avid swimmers and sailors. They sail around the western coasts of the continent and conduct trade through this aswell. Some of them also venture out further into the west and north in search of new lands. Some of them have returned and have told stories that are difficult to belive, but maybe this will lead to new discoveries one day.
