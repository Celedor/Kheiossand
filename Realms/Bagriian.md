To the west of [[Pirusia]] in between high mountains on a plateau lies Bagriian.
Mostly inhabited by [[Goat People]] and is rather isolationistic

Inspired by Tibetan and Nepalese cultures

Fueled by their control over the local volcanoes and the local river, aswell as overseen by [[The Ashen Father]], this civilization has huge furnaces that produce new metals all around the day. They already use some proto-train-tracks and other mechanical wonders.

As they keep largely to themselves, not much about them is known, but some individuals started to travel west into [[Vejtals]] and so slowly some of their knowledge  gets spread into the world abroad, but it will take a long time until the rest of the world has caught up.
While they do not use magic as much as their neighbours, they still dabble alot in the fusion of magic and technology, artificery.
