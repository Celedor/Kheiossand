Kheiossand - land of the gods

The moon shaped island lies between the three continents of Urias to the west, Augand to the south and Uagris to the north. At the closest connection in the north of the island, the strait is about 100km apart.
Its citizens are mostly [[Orcs]] and [[Humans]], but they also boast a wide variety of [[Halflings]] and in lesser amounts also other races like [[Changelings]], [[Kianeroi]] and [[Vafthys]].

Kheiossand is influenced by all the cultures surrounding and inhabiting it. However, especially the naming convention is Greek inspired, but the language and cultures is a patchwork of all involved languages.

Originally set up as a peaceful and neutral common ground between the three continents and the different factions inside the [[Kheioi]] after the [[The Primordial Wars]], with changing factions, interests and completely new factions among the Kheioi, this original intent has changed greatly as well.
Now the city serves as a central hub for most of the trade in Kheiossar and as such is well visited by Halflings and many other people. It it also a very multicultural province and very urbanized. Its capital, also called Kheiossand, is the biggest city in all of Kheiossar.

It is ruled by a council of 6, where 3 of these seats are in perpetuity for the 3 Kheioi of [[The Puppeteer]], [[The Diplomat]] and [[The Magnate]], whereas the other 3 are elected every 6 years or upon death of the previous holder. Usually these seats are held by an Orc, a Human and a Halfling.

As such, the people of Kheiossand are a very proud people and love their state, but are very accepting of immigrants.
