Prennso lies directly west to [[Kheiossand]], on the other side of the straight.
It is mostly inhabited by [[Orcs]], as it is their homeland, but especially the eastern coast and the isthmus of the river has large [[Halflings|Halfling]] and [[Humans|Human]] population with many other people living there as well, mostly focused around the cities themselves.

Prennso is very much inspired by France and the HRE

In name, [[The Justicar]] rules the realm entirely, but at this point the local princes and lords hold most of the actual power in their own realms. In the beginning, this realm started out as a centralized homeland for the orcs. In those times it also stretched to the north of the continent. However over time the Justicar got more distant and sank into despair, for he lost much during [[The Primordial Wars]] and the loss still burdens him heavily.
Having seen the danger magic could pose and being scared of loosing his own power through something like it, he created a centralized church in the HRE and gave much power to it, the [[Church of the Righteous Sun]]. This church then started to crack down on mages and other magic users, hunting and burning any they could find. Nowadays, there are only very few mages left in Prennso and most have fled to the neighboring lands like [[Grüdsandt]] to the north, which just recently split off, or to Kheiossand. Naturally, the Justicar also has a rivalry with [[The Iridescent Magus]] and their realms are also not on the best relations with each other.
As he grew more distant and cold, his power vaned. And with that, the power shifted from him to the local lords and princes.

The Justicar still resides in his capital and governs over the small circle around it, but with his loss in power, the entire northern part of his realm split off in search of independence and self governance as they developed an entirely different culture and become Grüdsandt.

There are regionalization's by now, with the east and south being very rich, as they have easy access to the global trading routes and are close to Kheiossand. The southern plains are renowned for their horsemanship and similar things.

At the very south of the realm lies the Palatinate, ruled by [[The Apprentice]], another [[Kheioi|Kheios]]. Technically they would be the heir to the Justicar, but as they are ageless, that is mostly an honorary title. However, it is widely known that the true power is held by the Apprentice. The south is also a very rich region, with it being pretty much between the southern part of [[Vejtals]], Kheiossand and [[Pirusia]].

## Recent Events

Relatively recently the Justicar got assassinated. The assailant got killed by the Justicar, but he succumbed to his wounds. This sent shockwaves throughout the region and scared all Kheioi.
Prennso quickly descended into the Prenntic Civil War, with the Church of the Righteous Sun taking up the mantle of the Justicar in the former capital and hunting down any remaining arcane practitioners in their borders, the Apprentice calling out the Prenntic Empire and trying to unite Prennso in a centralized empire, Grüdsandt expanding its influence, many harbor-towns bonding together in a merchant republic and many other towns and cities trying to gain their own independence.
