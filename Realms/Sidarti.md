Sidarti - Land of the morning sun

Sidarti lies on the banks of the Ariyyian Kingdom and is pretty much only inhabited by [[Elves]], as the nation is rather isolationist.

Influenced by Egyptian culture and various pre-Islamic Arabian cultures.

The River is at the center of most of Ariyyian civilization and the cult of [[The Great River Mother]] is by far the strongest institution, in many fields even surpassing the crown.

Its name comes from the morning hours at dawn where the rising sun is in the east appears at the horizon and fills the entire desert with its golden light.
The people of Sidarti are very proud of their heritage and culture and very traditional. They don't like to meddle with outsiders and prefer to stay to themselves. They do trade with the outside through the trade ports in the delta, but this is very limited.
