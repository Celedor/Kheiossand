Pirusia lies on the landmass to the south of [[Kheiossand]] and to the west of the core of [[Vejtals]]. It is nearly uniformly inhabited by [[Humans]], with the few non-humans living in it not having a good time, as the state is very totalitarian.

Pirusia is culturally and linguistically influenced by Italy and Iberia.

Pirusia is ruled by [[The Iridescent Magus]] and his close circle of powerful human mages. Together they rule from the magical university complex in the capital and rarely leave the capital or even the complex.

However, by magical means and local magnates they are able to keep a very tight grip on the population. It is believed here that being able to use magic of any kind is an inherited ability and clerical magic doesn't exist. This of course isn't the case, but it helps to keep the status quo.
Any child that is found to have an affinity for magic is being brought into the capital to be taught magic and included into the state.

While there are a few cities, Pirusia does have a large degree of ruralization and most people live in rural villages. While these villages are also kept under watch by the Iridescent Magus, it is more difficult for them to completely surveil these.

In recent times with the knowledge that the [[Kheioi]] can be hurt slowly seeping into Pirusia, unrests are rising and the Iridescent Magus' iron grip on the country seems to be faltering. Only time can tell how this will go.
