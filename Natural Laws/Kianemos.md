In Kheiossar magic is abundant and usually is an invisible force that is present in the background. Some places have more of it than others.
It happens sometimes naturally, that a spring of pure Kianemos appears in nature. If this happens, it looks similar to naphtha, or stone oil. However, the form Kianemos then takes, is a heavy gas of a blue and violet color.
Most magic, be it arcane or clerical, uses energy from this force. Although some, like fire magic, use a lot more of it than others. A more experienced or more powerful magic user can draw from this force more efficiently or just in larger amounts.
If this force is used up, which usually only happens if big rituals or a persistent stream of magic is used like through factories, no more energy can be drawn from this and all magic has to feed on internal energy from the magic user. However, if this force is used up, it takes a lot longer to recharge and the land becomes barren and inhospitable for a long while.

Some nations, like [[Pirusia]], use infrastructure which collects excess and abundant magical force and brings it to reservoirs, which then can be used when needed.

Healing magic cannot draw directly from this force. It either has to be refined for this specific purpose, which is expensive and complicated, or the force has to be drawn from the magic user directly.
If the second way is used, the magic user will need to rest and recharge in order to regain this power. How long the person has to recharge depends on how powerful this person is and how much energy is used.
In order to combat this, hospitals employ a lot of mundane doctors and surgeons and only a small part are magic healers. Nations with the necessary infrastructure have more magic healers, but will still employ a large amount of mundane doctors and surgeons.
Resurrection is even rarer and only the most expert magic healers can do this, often at risk of their own life force.
