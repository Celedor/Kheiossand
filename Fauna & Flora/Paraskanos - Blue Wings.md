As these butterflies feed on pure [[Kianemos]], they were incredibly rare before the current magical infrastructure was built. Now they are rather common in [[Pirusia]] and in bigger cities, with many seeing them as some sort of pest, because if they get into the reservoirs, they will empty it, given enough time. That being said, they can also be used to find leaks and path them before more damage is caused.
In bigger cities, they are now often found in huge swarms flying around, similar to starlings.

Their wingspan is about 20cm or roughly the size of a common finch. Their wings are entirely a very bright blue, with their bodies being black. A soft light is being emitted from their wings, which makes them look ethereal and often mistaken for fairy lights or similar.
