These large and strong equine animals have in the past been very widespread in Kheiossar. They live in large herds, very akin to the common Zebras or Horses. While their numbers already help to deter any would be predators, they do use their long and strong horn situated on their forehead in self defense, using it as a club or, more commonly, to pierce the predator. It is even said, that their horns through some means are able to channel [[Kianemos]] directly and so give the Unicorn some magical abilities.

Thanks to their horns and the martial prowess needed to actually hunt them, they have been a prime hunting target among many cultures for a long while, be it for the magical prowess promised by their horns, the beauty of the animals or the martial challenge hunting those animals would give. This unfortunately has brought these animals to be nearly extinct at this point. Only a very few remote herds actually still roam free and thanks to the ruthless hunting, the remaining herds have become extremely aggressive and will attack the would-be-hunters without second thought or hesitation.
