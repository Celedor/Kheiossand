These songbird-sized butterflies live and hunt in small swarms of up to twenty individuals.  They are usually found on old battlefields, lush forests and jungles, as well as graveyards, to a lesser extent. In the [[Caverns]] underneath [[Kheiossand]], where a lot is uncertain, huge swarms of at least fifty individuals have been reported, but no one knows what they feed on down there.

While they can feed on nectar, due to their size and number, this is usually not very efficient, so they would rather opt to blood and corpses.
As most normal butterflies, their test buds are on their feet, so in order to find prey, they land on bodies, be that animal or humanoid, and they taste decay or blood, they will call the rest of the swarm and start to drain their (usually dead) victim.
One such body can last a swarm for up to two weeks.

The butterflies have a wingspan of up to 100cm and are as such roughly as big as common ravens. Their coloration resembles their diet and their wings are intricate and beautiful patterns of black and red.
