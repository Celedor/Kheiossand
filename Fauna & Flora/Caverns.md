Long before the city of [[Kheiossand]] was founded, there were the extensive cavern systems, filled with various fungal lifeforms, great beasts and ancient structures.
These caverns stretch throughout all of Kheiossar and there are few connections to the surface above. Due to its extensive and maze-like structure only a small portion of its truly explored and much more is a mystery. There could be [[Primordials]] or entirely different societies down there for all anyone knows.
