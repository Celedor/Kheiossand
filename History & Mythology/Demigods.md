While extremely rare, it is possible for the [[Kheioi]] to have children with mortals. They usually have a gender associated with them, but their magic is powerful and they can shapeshift, including to the other gender.
If it does happen, it's usually seen as a great blessing (but not always) and usually the child and mother get treated better in most nations, if it's in the respective Kheios' domaine.
Due to it being such a rare thing, many people do not know about this being a possibility and most go about their lives without ever encountering a demigod.

A demigod is always the race of their mother, but a head or two taller. They are also imbued by powerful magic, inheriting a small portion of their parent's magic, giving them a strong connection to [[Kianemos]]. This also shows in their bodies, giving them mutations. All of them have piercing blue eyes, which shine even brighter if they use their power and most have other mutations as well, this might include blue scales or scars on their skin, horns, wings, halos or more.

They are often progenitors of a sorcerer line like [[The Palaima Family]]
