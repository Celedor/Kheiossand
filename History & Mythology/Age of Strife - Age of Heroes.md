Most races were created at the end of [[The Primordial Wars]]. Some were created even sooner ([[Changelings]] for example). The majority of them did wake up roughly where their realms are now. Some wandered for a time through the lands in search of a better land.

While there weren't many [[Primordials]] left, they still had to fend for themselves and fight against raging beasts and horrors that walked in the wake of the Primordials.
Most Primordials were already vanquished by the [[Kheioi]] but there were some left in the mainlands of Kheiossar. The races fought these few Primordials and through a lot of sacrifices, bloodshed and the bravery of outstanding individuals, the heroes of this age.
The leftover bodies of these Primordials often served as foundations for big cities, sometimes they were built inside of their ribcage, others were built at the foot of a Primordial's head etc.

This Age of Strife forged cultural identities for many of the cultures among the races, which often times still persist to this day.
Once the Kheioi vanquished the Primordials far enough, they returned and ruled over their people, which saw an end to the individual cultures and united the races. However, these cultures still serve as a kindle for the fire of independence and freedom in Kheiossar.
